OMG dude, just walked out of Kesari Chapter 2... my mind is a whirlwind of thoughts. The Untold Story of Jallianwala Bagh is freakin' intense. Noise, so much noise in the theater, or was it just my brain trying to process everything? My back is killing me sitting in those seats like... like a pretzel stuck in a too-tight can. Popcorn crumbs, everywhere, reminding me of that one absurd scene where the protagonist was - what? - dancing through chaos? Or was I imagining that?

> The way they showed the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, it's like... blending grim history and Bollywood drama in a blender and hitting 'explode.' Seriously, how did they even think of framing that chaos? I mean, you've seen those emotional roller coasters, but this one? It was, like, every feeling was sharp and jagged, just 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ling in the air.

Oh, and that moment, was it rain or just, like, tears in slow-mo? Absolute bonkers! My head's spinning faster than a Bollywood hero can break into song. Whatever the real sequences were... I've lost them somewhere around the scene with the giant flag, its like they tried to wrestle with history and came out with bruises. Oh, oh, and the music - totally unexpected melody during that tragic climax, like... why plaid shirts at an opera?!

Did you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   already? If not, you should definitely 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   ASAP, coz really, it's another beast of Bollywood madness. Sometimes the storytelling... felt like connecting stars in a sky where none existed. Yeah, that weird.

> The noise... or maybe it was just leftover special effects clogging my senses like soggy bread. Somehow, it was bright, deafening with the echoes of old spirits. Or was that just the theater’s ancient speakers wheezing their last breath? I couldn't tell, just felt like a fog trying to sort scenes—random flashes of injustice, defiance, and heroics less than a heartbeat apart.

And gosh, some dialogue, can’t even remember them exactly, just the feeling they left. It’s like trying to recall the taste of a forgotten candy. Sweet? Bitter? What was the color even? It's like trying to capture rain with chopsticks, you get the madness.

And at the end, what the heck was that dance? No, no, I'm way too confused. Are we supposed to laugh, cry, or... or both? Maybe both. Not sure if it was the   or just the exhaustion of sitting for so long.

Anyway, gotta go. Let me know when you catch it. Make sure to have tea ready, lots of it. Or maybe coffee, whichever grabs your emotional sanity afterward... Oh wait, did I mess up copying something??
